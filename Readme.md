In this project, I built an entire project with different technologies work together. 

I also added file upload, authentication, authorization and deployed my MERN app.

In detail, this project includes:

The core technologies (React, Node, Express, MongoDB)

Project sections for each technology where the theoretic knowledge is applied

A complete project where all the technologies come together into one application

File (image) upload in both React.js (sending the file) and Node/ Express (receiving the file)

User authentication (signup + login)

User authorization (controlling access to certain resources)

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/livetoworldlife/project_bluedot_location.git

npm install

```

## Usage
